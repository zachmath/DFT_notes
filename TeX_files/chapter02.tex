\chapter{Time-dependent Hartree-Fock and the inertia tensor}

Originally this development is based on \cite{Engel1975}, and a retelling in notes by Nicolas which I have on paper but not digitally.


Some of this (specifically that relating to the inertia tensor and the cranking approximation) is mentioned in \cite{Baran2011}
