abstract = {Collective mass tensor derived from the cranking approximation to the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) approach is compared with that obtained in the Gaussian Overlap Approximation (GOA) to the generator coordinate method. Illustrative calculations are carried out for one-dimensional quadrupole fission pathways in 256Fm. It is shown that the collective mass exhibits strong variations with the quadrupole collective coordinate. These variations are related to the changes in the intrinsic shell structure. The differences between collective inertia obtained in cranking and perturbative cranking approximations to ATDHFB, and within GOA, are discussed.},

@article{Engel1975,
abstract = {The time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory (TDHF) and its adiabatic approximation (ATDHF) are formulated in coordinate space using effective density-dependent interactions of Skyrme type. For this purpose it is necessary to derive the energy density of a Slater determinant without assuming the single-particle states to be invariant under time-reversal. The corresponding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is obtained by varying the total energy with respect to the single-particle density matrix. With the Skyrme interaction TDHF theory leads to an equation of continuity for the single-particle density. The ATDHF equation is transformed into a finite set of inhomogeneous differential equations. Hydrodynamic-like expressions for the collective kinetic energy are established in case the single-particle wave functions have certain generalised scaling properties. TDHF and ATDHF are applied to the description of isoscalar monopole vibrations in 16O and 40Ca. ?? 1975.},

@article{Schunck2015FTfission,
abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of induced nuclear fission for a broad range of neutron energies could help resolve fundamental science issues, such as the formation of elements in the universe, but could have also a large impact on societal applications in energy production or nuclear waste management. The goal of this paper is to set up the foundations of a microscopic theory to study the static aspects of induced fission as a function of the excitation energy of the incident neutron, from thermal to fast neutrons. To account for the high excitation energy of the compound nucleus, we employ a statistical approach based on finite temperature nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme energy densities, which we benchmark on the 239Pu(n,f ) reaction.We compute the evolution of the least-energy fission pathway across multidimensional potential energy surfaces with up to five collective variables as a function of the nuclear temperature and predict the evolution of both the inner and the outer fission barriers as a function of the excitation energy of the compound nucleus.We show that the coupling to the continuum induced by the finite temperature is negligible in the range of neutron energies relevant for many applications of neutron-induced fission. We prove that the concept of quantum localization introduced recently can be extended to T{\textgreater} 0, and we apply the method to study the interaction energy and total kinetic energy of fission fragments as a function of the temperature for the most probable fission. While large uncertainties in theoretical modeling remain, we conclude that a finite temperature nuclear density functional may provide a useful framework to obtain accurate predictions of fission fragment properties.

abstract = {We describe the fission dynamics of 240Pu within an implementation of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) extended to superfluid systems and real-time dynamics. We demonstrate the critical role played by the pairing correlations, which even though are not the driving force in this complex dynamics, are providing the essential lubricant, without which the nuclear shape evolution would come to a screeching halt. The evolution is found to be much slower than previously expected in this fully non-adiabatic treatment of nuclear dynamics, where there are no symmetry restrictions and all collective degrees of freedom (CDOF) are allowed to participate in the dynamics.},
