abstract = {Collective mass tensor derived from the cranking approximation to the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) approach is compared with that obtained in the Gaussian Overlap Approximation (GOA) to the generator coordinate method. Illustrative calculations are carried out for one-dimensional quadrupole fission pathways in 256Fm. It is shown that the collective mass exhibits strong variations with the quadrupole collective coordinate. These variations are related to the changes in the intrinsic shell structure. The differences between collective inertia obtained in cranking and perturbative cranking approximations to ATDHFB, and within GOA, are discussed.},

@article{Engel1975,
abstract = {The time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory (TDHF) and its adiabatic approximation (ATDHF) are formulated in coordinate space using effective density-dependent interactions of Skyrme type. For this purpose it is necessary to derive the energy density of a Slater determinant without assuming the single-particle states to be invariant under time-reversal. The corresponding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is obtained by varying the total energy with respect to the single-particle density matrix. With the Skyrme interaction TDHF theory leads to an equation of continuity for the single-particle density. The ATDHF equation is transformed into a finite set of inhomogeneous differential equations. Hydrodynamic-like expressions for the collective kinetic energy are established in case the single-particle wave functions have certain generalised scaling properties. TDHF and ATDHF are applied to the description of isoscalar monopole vibrations in 16O and 40Ca. ?? 1975.},
